This rule outlines the purpose and usage guidelines for key documentation files within the project. Adhering to these helps maintain context, consistency, and project alignment.

### Core Documentation Usage

**`@docs/TODO.md`**
*   **Purpose**: Running task list, ordered by priority (top = next most important). Completed tasks marked with ✅ are moved to the bottom.
*   **Usage**:
    *   **Read**: Before starting *and* after completing any task.
    *   **Update**:
        *   Move completed tasks (with ✅) below active tasks and add a timestamp for the current day (e.g., `[YYYY-MM-DD]`) indicating when it was completed.
        *   Add newly identified tasks (features, ideas, deferred items) below existing active tasks but above the completed ones.
